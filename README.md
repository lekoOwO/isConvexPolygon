from isConvexPolygon import *

# point [x,y]
# points = [point1, point2 ...]
# line = [a,b,c] (ax+by+c=0)
# nums = [num1, num2 ...]

isAtSameSide(points, line) # if points are at the same side of the line
isSameSign(nums) # if nums are same-signed
line(point1, point2) # returns a line which determined by the 2 points

```
